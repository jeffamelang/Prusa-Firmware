Preheating nozzle. Please wait.
Loading filament
Please insert filament into the extruder, then press the knob to load it.
Please insert filament into the first tube of the MMU, then press the knob to load it.
The printer will start printing a zig-zag line. Rotate the knob until you reach the optimal height. Check the pictures in the handbook (Calibration chapter).
Select temperature which matches your material.
Choose a filament for the First Layer Calibration and select it in the on-screen menu.
Now I will calibrate distance between tip of the nozzle and heatbed surface.
You can always resume the Wizard from Calibration -> Wizard.
Please check our handbook and fix the problem. Then resume the Wizard by rebooting the printer.
All is done. Happy printing!
If you have additional steel sheets, calibrate their presets in Settings - HW Setup - Steel sheets.
Please clean heatbed and then press the knob.
Do you want to repeat last step to readjust distance between nozzle and heatbed?
Select nozzle preheat temperature which matches your material.
Is filament loaded?
Now I will preheat nozzle for PLA.
I will run z calibration now.
Now remove the test print from steel sheet.
Please remove shipping helpers first.
I will run xyz calibration now. It will take approx. 12 mins.
First, I will run the selftest to check most common assembly problems.
Hi, I am your Original Prusa i3 printer. Would you like me to guide you through the setup process?
Hi, I am your Original Prusa i3 printer. I will guide you through a short setup process, in which the Z-axis will be calibrated. Then, you will be ready to print.
